/*
 * DBMS tables for the ICIC Central Database Repository
 *
 * This script contains the definitions for the tables and views
 * contained in the two CDR database, as well as documentation for
 * those tables and views and each of the columns which they contain.
 *
 * The two tables which form the core of the repository are the
 * all_docs and the all_doc_versions tables (used through the
 * corresponding views document and doc_version). The xml columns
 * in these tables contain the serialization for all of the CDR
 * XML documents. Everything else in the system exists to support
 * these documents. The other tables include:
 *  - tables to record user accounts, session, groups, and permissions
 *  - tables to control different document types
 *  - tables to support workflow (document locking, auditing, etc.)
 *  - tables to hold multimedia and other blobs associated with documents
 *  - tables to manage inter-document linking
 *  - tables to support document search/selection
 *  - tables to map internal identifiers to identifiers in external systems
 *  - tables to manage publication and other batch jobs
 *  - tables to manage import from and export to external systems (obsolete)
 *
 * This script assumes the cdr and cdr_archived_versions tables have been
 * freshly created, with no user tables.
