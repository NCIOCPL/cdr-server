 * of an attribute.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2001/07/20 14:55:02  bkline
 * Added support for ID/IDREF.  Added hasAttribute() method to Schema
 * type.  First cut at elemsWithAttr() method.
 *

 * mismatched content error report; fixed reversed logic test bug;
 * added getValidValueSets command.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/05/03 18:46:10  bkline

 *
 * Revision 1.9  2000/10/05 21:27:22  bkline
 * Moved most of the lower-level schema validation routines into this module;
 * added more specific information to the error messages sent back when a
 * base type name is omitted or the base type can't be found.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2000/10/04 18:36:39  bkline

 * Added lookup hash for attributes.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2000/04/26 01:29:23  bkline
 * Added more lookup support, for finding a element's type when the element
 * is encountered in an unexpected place (so we can validate it anyway) and
 * for determining which elements are allowed in a MIXED content element.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2000/04/16 22:45:15  bkline
 * Added #pragma to disable annoying warnings about truncated debugging
 * information.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/04/12 14:25:34  bkline
 * Removed debugging output.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/04/11 21:22:58  bkline
